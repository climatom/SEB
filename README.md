# Readme
This repository contains code to model the surface energy balance (SEB) of glaciers. At the moment it is likely only useful to its creator (me!). 

Briefly: 

- 'core.py' contains the core numerical routines for solving the energy balance 
- 'seb_utils.py' has helper functions to manipulate the met data
- 'run_seb.py' provides an example invocation of the routines to compute the energy balance (and melt/ablation)

Any queries should be directed to t.matthews@lboro.ac.uk
